# compass_php_project.
Our professor taught us the basics of php until forms,
then he task us to do a website based on the pictures he showed us
but there are rules: dont change the theme, color, pictures, and logos. 
That's whhy the pictures here are outdated, no proper aspect ratio, and just trash.
I did 90% of this but since this is by pair  i let my classmate help me a bit he did 3 files all starts with detail and he also did the search function but the designs are inline css, i don't know why.
Our prof is not that strict with the grading of this and he said we dont need to do the travelLog database since the main point is forms. We got 99 and it is jut a one week project.
